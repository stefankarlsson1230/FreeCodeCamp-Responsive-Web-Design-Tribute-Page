## Responsive Web Design
### Tribute Page

This was the second of five projects to achieve the *Responsive Web Design* Certificate 

[This page](https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks) was what I had to recreate, and [this](https://stefankarlsson1230.github.io/FreeCodeCamp-Responsive-Web-Design-Tribute-Page/) was my result.
